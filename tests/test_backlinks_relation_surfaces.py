"""A backlink says what the source's file wrote, on every surface (#527).

`informs` is not a declared relationship type. A backlinks row for it carries
`forward_relation` ("informs", source -> this entry, as written),
`relation` (this entry's reading, the stored inverse; `related_to` for an
unknown relation) and `inverse_relation` (the declared inverse, null when
there is none). The CLI path is pinned in test_link_relation_distinct.py; this
file enters through REST (`TestClient`) and MCP (`kb_backlinks`).
